    		We live in a world that is digitized, where communication has been much discussed. Communication between hearing and deaf has always been an important topic in the digitized world. Phone calls have been replaced by text messages, emails and video calls, but the problem is still there. How can deaf people communicate face to face with those who are able to hear? That’s exactly what our app will solve. Our app “IUY – I understand you” will prevent the communication wall from coming between the hearing and the hearing impaired. IUY will be a two-way communication app that translates signs to text and speech, and text and speech to signs.

    	<div class="problemText">How does the app work?</div>
    	<div class="probemText2"><p>
    		
    		To start using this app, you’ll have to download it on your mobile or tablet. It can be downloaded on every kind of mobile, Iphone, Ipad, tablet devices. IUY will scan signs then translate it into text or speech. IUY has a unique technique that connects to the camera on your device and scans your hand gestures into text and speech using special detection software. When someone speaks, IUY will convert the speech into text or signs, this will appear on the screen.Our app is also connected to gloves that allow you to communicate via the app without having to open the camera on the app. This allows the hearing impaired to use both hands to communicate. The glove has special sensors that responds to the movements, and pass them on to the app. The app will be able to translate characters into correct grammatical full sentences. You can also add words to the template on the app. This is an easier way for you who do not always want to scan characters. You can thus use words from the template too highlight your message. You can read more about the app here: prototype
